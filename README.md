In this project we will focus on sentiment analysis of IMDb movie reviews to automatically
classify them as positive or negative. Using the IMDb 50K Movie Reviews dataset
from Kaggle, our study applies traditional Machine Learning techniques—Naive Bayes,
Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Artificial
Neural Networks (ANN)—after text preprocessing and TF-IDF vectorization.
The main objectives are to preprocess the text, compare different classification models,
and analyze the most discriminative words for each sentiment. This project aims to
demonstrate the effectiveness of classical Machine Learning methods in sentiment analysis
